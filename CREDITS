The following people have contributed to 'sysstat' in one way or another:

	First I would like to thank Michael <michael [at] roka.net>: He is the
	very first person to have given me feedback about sysstat, and to
	point out to me that certain fields in /proc/stat didn't have the
	meaning I thought they had. This was in 1999!

	Many thanks to the translators involved in sysstat:

	  * Birko Bergt <birko.bergt [at] gmx.de> for his translation into
	    German,
	  * Fernando Félix Redondo <fernando.felix [at] rediris.es> for his
	    translation into Spanish (now maintained by Muralito
	    <muralito [at] montevideo.com.uy>),
	  * Frederic L. W. Meunier <0 [at] pervalidus.net> for the
	    Portuguese translation.
	  * Gert Brits <gbrits [at] techconcepts.co.za> for the translation
	    into Afrikaans.
	  * Roy Sigurd Karlsbakk <roy [at] karlsbakk.net> for the Norwegian
	    translation.
	  * Stefano Barni <barninga [at] interfree.it> for the translation
	    into Italian.
	  * Dennis Selsky <selsky [at] siberia.net> for the Russian translation.
	  * Eugen Hoanca <eugenh [at] urban-grafx.ro> for the Romanian
	    translation.
	  * Robert Luberda <robert [at] debian.org> for the translation into
	    Polish.
	  * Miroslav David <md20128 [at] decef.elf.stuba.sk> for the slovak
	    translation.

	Carl-Christian Weber <ccweber [at] itz-koeln.de> helped me to make sar
	work on SMP machines.

	Stefan Majer <smajer [at] advance-bank.de> provided me with a patch to
	rotate daily system activity files.

	Klaus Franken <klaus.franken [at] fth2.siemens.de> created the RPM
	packages. He also included a short initialization script for sar
	to start it as a daemon on boot.

	Jason (Jay) R. Fink <jay_rf [at] exis.net> set up and maintained the
	first web site for sysstat.

	Preston Brown <pbrown [at] redhat.com> sent me the RedHat patch to
	enable good packaging.

	David Doubrava <linux_monitor [at] volny.cz> created the isag
	command (Interactive System Activity Graph).

	Rik van Riel <riel [at] conectiva.com.br> explained me the meaning
	of several fields that were added in Linux kernel 2.4
	/proc/meminfo file.

	Hubert Nueckel <hubert.nueckel [at] oracle.com> sent me a patch to
	fix CPU utilization displayed by sar, iostat and mpstat commands
	on IA64 machines.

	Victor Hazlewood <victor [at] sdsc.edu> sent me a patch to implement
	a database friendly option for sar (option -H).

	Christopher Blizzard <blizzard [at] redhat.com> added the ability to
	display kB/s transfers to devices in iostat reporting when
	option -x is used.

	John Caruso <caruso [at] paradiso.umuc.edu> wrote the sargon script
	shell as a replacement for sa1/sa2 files.

	Wilhelm Nuesser <wilhelm.nuesser [at] sap.com> sent me a patch to
	fix average wait times and service times displayed by iostat -x.

	Rick Lindsley <ricklind [at] us.ibm.com> has played a great part in
	making sysstat work on kernels 2.5 and above.

	John Salmon <John.Salmon [at] cw.com> wrote a patch to enable file
	locking for sadc (option -L).

	Jim W. Jaszewski <grok [at] sprint.ca> fixed several typos in
	sysstat FAQ!
