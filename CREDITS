The following people have contributed to 'sysstat' in one way or another:

	First I would like to thank Michael <michael@roka.net>: he is the
	very first person to have given me feedback about sysstat, and to
	point out to me that certain fields in /proc/stat didn't have the
	meaning I thought they had. This was in 1999!

	Many thanks to the translators involved in sysstat:

	  * Birko Bergt <birko.bergt@cdc.com> for his translation in german,
	  * Fernando Félix Redondo <fernando.felix@rediris.es> for his
	    translation in spanish,
	  * Frederic L. W. Meunier <linux@olympiquedemarseille.org> for the
	    portuguese translation.

	Carl-Christian Weber <ccweber@itz-koeln.de> helped me to make sar
	work on SMP machines.

	Stefan Majer <smajer@advance-bank.de> provided me with a patch to
	rotate daily system activity files.

	Klaus Franken <klaus.franken@fth2.siemens.de> created the RPM
	packages. He also included a short initialization script for sar
	to start it as a daemon on boot.

	Mario Vanoni <vanonim@dial.eunet.ch> is the originator of the 2.x
	to 3.x version transition. Thanks to his numerous advice and his
	experience on UN*X systems, he helped me to make sar what I think
	today is a true system monitoring program.

	Jason (Jay) R. Fink <jay_rf@exis.net> set up and maintained the
	first web site for sysstat.

	Preston Brown <pbrown@redhat.com> sent me the RedHat patch to
	enable good packaging.

	David Doubrava <linux_monitor@volny.cz> created the isag
	command (Interactive System Activity Graph).
