The latest version of sysstat can always be found at Metalab in the
following directory:

ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/status/

sysstat home page is now at:

INSTALLATION
------------

The sysstat utilities are a collection of performance monitoring tools for
Linux. These include mpstat, iostat, sar and sa tools. 

The current release of the sysstat package no longer contains a patch for the
Linux kernel. I do not want to maintain it any more. The last patch (version 4)
is still available on my web site (http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.godard/)
for download.

See the CHANGES file to know the new features/improvements/bug fixes added
in this release of sysstat.

The first stage is to configure sysstat for your system:

	make config

This is useful to change some configuration variables, for instance if you
want to choose installation directories.
Answer the questions or enter Return to accept the default values.
For yes/no questions, please answer 'y' or 'n' (without the quotes): it is
case sensitive! You can also enter '?' to get a help message.
Configuring your system is not compulsory. If not done, sysstat will use
a default configuration file...

The next stage is to build the various binary files. Enter:

	make

Then log in as root and enter:

	make install

(see next section to know the installed files).

Of course tell me if there are any problems. This is the only way I can improve
'sysstat'. But if you wanna raise my morale, you can also send me reports of
successful use instead of bug reports ;-)
Patches and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!
Send everything to <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>.


FILES THAT ARE INSTALLED
------------------------

I _hate_ when packages install files eveywhere on my disk and I don't know
where...
So here is the list of files installed by sysstat, when you ask for a
complete installation.
${PREFIX} is the value of the PREFIX variable defined in the Makefile
(usually set to /usr/local or /usr).

${PREFIX}/lib/sa/sadc
${PREFIX}/lib/sa/sa1
${PREFIX}/lib/sa/sa2
${PREFIX}/bin/sar
${PREFIX}/bin/iostat
${PREFIX}/bin/mpstat
${PREFIX}/man/man8/sadc.8

MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

The sar, mpstat and iostat commands are only front-ends to the kernel proc
filesystem... They cannot display statistics that Linux does not
provide, nor can they be more accurate than Linux is.
The sysstat package has been tested on Linux kernels 2.0.x and 2.2.x,
but since new statistics are added in sysstat, they are not necessarily
present in old 2.0.x kernels.

It has been designed with NLS support in mind, using the GNU gettext
package. At the present time, english, french, german, spanish and
portuguese translations are available.
You are welcome if you want to make other languages available ;-)
