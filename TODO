Here are the things I would like (or I should) do for the next releases:

* Add a vmstat command (not sure about this, since it already exists in common
  Linux distributions).

* Add more statistics to sar and mpstat (and iostat) when available in Linux
  kernels.
  Numerous network activities are already available (see /proc/snmp for
  example), but I am rather reluctant to display them: There are too many of
  them and sar becomes bigger and bigger...

* Add new fields to sar -d: avgrq-sz and avgqu-sz.

* Try to add new fields to sar -B and sar -W (pgscan, pgfree, pgsteal, etc.).

* Use autoconf to configure sysstat.

* Add support for hotplug CPU ?

* Dynamically allocate structures for IRQs (just like for CPUs).

* Check I/O wait type (long int?, int?) read in /proc/stat and in /sys/.../stat.

* Cast cpu stats (user, nice, system) for sar, iostat and mpstat to unsigned
  long instead of unsigned int (Greg Edwards <edwardsg [at] sgi.com>).
  Idem for other stats.

* Handle little/big endian architectures for sar daily data files
  (Ferenci Daniel <Daniel.Ferenci [at] siemens.com>).
