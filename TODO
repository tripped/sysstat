Here are the things I would like (or I should) do for the next releases:

* sar -q should also display ldavg-15.

* Remove kbmemshrd from sar -r.

* Add more disk activity data to sar.

* Add a vmstat command (not sure about this, since it already exists in common
  Linux distributions).

* Get rid of the limit on the number of processors (NR_CPUS).

* Add more statistics to sar and mpstat (and iostat) when available in Linux
  kernels.
  Numerous network activities are already available (see /proc/snmp for
  example), but I am rather reluctant to display them: There are too many of
  them and sar becomes bigger and bigger...

* Implement a "-P" option for sar to display all statistics on a per-processor
  basis.

* Use ./configure to configure sysstat.

* Add support for hotplug CPU ?

* Check I/O wait type (long int?, int?) read in /proc/stat.

* Update translations.

* One should be able to enter the device for which stats are needed even
  if option -x is not used with iostat.

* Make the code more rock solid by avoiding assumptions.

* SMP race workaround should no longer be enabled by default.
