_Description: Do you want to activate sysstat's cron job?
 If this option is enabled the sysstat package will collect (using the cron
 daemon and init.d script) binary data concerning system activities and store
 them in log files within /var/log/sysstat/ directory.

 With this data the sar(1) command will be able to display day-long system
 statistics.

 If you don't enable this option, the sar(1) command will show only the
 current statistics.
