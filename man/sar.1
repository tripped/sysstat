.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sar
command writes to standard output the contents of selected
cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting
system, based on the values in the
.I count
and
.I interval
parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced
at the specified intervals in seconds.
If the interval parameter is set to zero, the
.B sar
command displays the average statistics for the time
since the system was started. The default value for the
.I count
parameter is 1. If its value is set to zero, then reports are
generated continuously.
The collected data can also
be saved in the file specified by the
.B -o
.I filename
flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If
.I filename
is omitted, sar uses the standard system activity daily data file,
the
.IR /var/log/sa/sa dd
file, where the dd parameter indicates the current day.

The
.B sar
command extracts and writes to standard output records previously
saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the
.B -f
flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file.

Without the
.B -P
flag, the
.B sar
command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics,
which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages,
and as sums otherwise. If the
.B -P
flag is given, the
.B sar
command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or
processors. If
.B -P ALL
is given, the
.B sar
command reports statistics for each individual processor and global
statistics among all processors.

You can select information about specific system activities using
flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
Specifying the
.B -A
flag is equivalent to specifying
.BR "-bBcdqrRuvwWy -I SUM -n FULL -P ALL".

The default version of the
.B sar
command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities
the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it
monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent
(user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.

If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient
to specify an output file for the
.B sar
command. 
Run the
.B sar
command as a background process. The syntax for this is:

.B sar -o data.file interval count >/dev/null 2>&1 &

All data is captured in binary form and saved to a file (data.file).
The data can then be selectively displayed with the
.B sar
command using the
.B -f
option. Set the
.I count
parameter to select records at
.I count
second intervals. If this parameter is not set, all the records saved in the
file will be selected.
Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize
system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.

Note:	The
.B sar
command only reports on local activities.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -A
This is equivalent to specifying
.BR "-bBcdqrRuvwWy -I SUM -n FULL -P ALL".
.IP -b
Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. This option works only with
kernels older than 2.5.
The following values are displayed:

.B tps
.RS
.RS
Total number of transfers per second that were issued to the physical disk.
A transfer is an I/O request to the physical disk. Multiple logical
requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the disk.
A transfer is of indeterminate size.
.RE

.B rtps
.RS
Total number of read requests per second issued to the physical disk.
.RE

.B wtps
.RS
Total number of write requests per second issued to the physical disk.
.RE

.B bread/s
.RS
Total amount of data read from the drive in blocks per second.
Blocks are equivalent to sectors with 2.4 kernels and newer
and therefore have a size of 512 bytes. With older kernels, a block is of
indeterminate size.
.RE

.B bwrtn/s
.RS
Total amount of data written to the drive in blocks per second.
.RE
.RE
.IP -B
Report paging statistics. The following values are displayed:

.B pgpgin/s
.RS
.RS
Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per second.
.RE

.B pgpgout/s
.RS
Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second.
.RE

.B fault/s
.RS
Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per second
(post 2.5 kernels only).
This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page
faults can be resolved without I/O.
.RE

.B majflt/s
.RS
Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which
have required loading a memory page from disk
(post 2.5 kernels only).
.RE
.RE
.IP -c
Report process creation activity.

.B proc/s
.RS
.RS
Total number of processes created per second.
.RE
.RE
.IP -d
Report activity for each block device (kernels 2.4 and newer only).
When data is displayed, the device specification
.I dev m-n
is generally used (
.B DEV
column).
.B m
is the major number of the device.
With recent kernels (post 2.5),
.B n
is the minor number of the device, but is only a sequence number with
pre 2.5 kernels.

.B tps
.RS
.RS
Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device.
Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the
device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.
.RE

.B rd_sec/s
.RS
Number of sectors read from the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes.
.RE

.B wr_sec/s
.RS
Number of sectors written to the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes.
.RE
.RE
.IP "-e hh:mm:ss"
Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is
18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.
This option can be used only when data are read from
or written to a file (options
.B -f
or
.B -o
). Note that if you also use
.B -h
option, ending time will have to be given in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
.IP "-f filename"
Extract records from
.I filename
(created by the
.B -o filename
flag). The default value of the
.B filename
parameter is the current daily data file, the
.IR /var/log/sa/sa dd
file. The -f option is exclusive of the -o option.
.IP -h
When  reading data from a file, print its contents in a format that can
easily be handled by pattern processing commands like awk.
The output consists of fields separated by a tab. Each record contains the
hostname of the host where sar was run, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable), the
timestamp (UTC value - Coordinated Universal Time) in seconds from the epoch,
the device name (or - if not applicable), the field name and its value.
.IP -H
When  reading data from a file, print its contents in a format that can easily
be ingested by a relational database system. The output consists
of fields separated by a semicolon. Each record contains
the hostname of the host where sar was run, the interval value
(or -1 if not applicable), the sar timestamp in a form easily acceptable by
most databases, and additional semicolon separated data fields as specified
by other sar command line options.
Note that the timestamp is displayed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
unless option -t is used. In this latter case, the timestamp is displayed
in local time.
.IP "-i interval"
Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the number specified
by the
.I interval
parameter.
.IP "-I irq | SUM | ALL | XALL"
Report statistics for a given interrupt.
.B irq

.IP "-s hh:mm:ss"
Set the starting time of the data, causing the
.B sar
command to extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time
specified. The default starting time is 08:00.
Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be
used only when data are read from a file (option

). Note that if you also use
.B -h
option, starting time will have to be given in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
.IP -t
When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that
.B sar
should display the timestamps in the original locale time of
the data file creator. Without this option, the
.B sar
command displays the timestamps in the user locale time.
When this option is used together with option -H, the timestamp
is displayed in local time instead of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
This option is ignored when option -h is used.
